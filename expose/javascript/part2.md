A. Accessing the value of the name property in the student object:
   student.name

B. Accessing the value of the Grad Year property in the student object
   student['Grad Year']

C. Calling the function for the greeting property in the student object
   student.greeting()

D. Accessing the name property of the object in the Favorite Teacher property in student
   student['Favorite Teacher'].name

E. Access index zero in the array of the courseLoad property of the student object
   student.courseLoad[0]

Part 3: Arithmetic
‘3’ + 2
Output: 32
Reason: It convert 2 to the string '2', then concatenate '3' with '2'. We get 32 in String form.

‘3’ - 2
Output: 1
Reason: It convert '3' to the number 3, then take 3 minus 2. We get 1 in Number form.

3 + null
Output: 3
Reason: It convert null to the number 0, then take 3 plus 0. We get 3 in Number form.

‘3’ + null
Output: 3null
Reason: It conver null to the string 'null', then concatenate '3' with 'null'. We get 3null in String form. 

true + 3
Output: 4
Reason: It convert true to the number 1, then take 1 plus 3. We get 4 in Number form.

false + null
Output: 0
Reason: It convert false to the number 0, null to the number 0, then take 0 plus 0. We get 0 in Number form.

'3' + undefined
Output: 3undefined
Reason: It convert undefined to the string 'undefined', then concatenate '3' with 'undefined'. We get 3undefined in String form.

'3' - undefined
Output: NaN
Reason: Since minus(-) indicate arithmetic subtraction between two numerical values. It convert '3' to the number 3, then it try to convert undefined to a numerical value, but failed. Therefore, the result is NaN.

Part 4: Comparison
‘2’ > 1
Output: 
Reason:

‘2’ < ‘12’
Output: 
Reason:

2 == ‘2’
Output: 
Reason:

2 === ‘2’
Output: 
Reason:

true == 2
Output: 
Reason:

true === Boolean(2)
Output: 
Reason:

Part 5: Explain the difference between the == and === operators.
